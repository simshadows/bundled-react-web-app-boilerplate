# react-tsx-ghpages-toolchain-test

In this repo, I incrementally introduce tooling to a simple static React project!

The goal is to use TSX, compile to minified (or better) code, introduce a testing framework, and have a sustainable workflow for hosting the application on GitHub Pages.

I'm currently still trying to figure it out though.
